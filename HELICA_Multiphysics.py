Using Helica, subsea engineers can reduce the analysis time to a fraction, as thousands of simulations may be performed in minutes. ')

st.markdown('### Stresses in dynamic umbilicals and flexible pipes')
st.markdown('Accurate evaluation of local stresses in complex cross-sections, e.g. of subsea umbilicals and flexible pipes, '
            'subjected to extreme and fatigue loading, is a challenge to the industry. Fatigue of cross-section components such '
            'as helix tensile armors and steel tubes is a critical design issue for dynamic umbilicals and flexible pipes.')
st.markdown('The basis for assessment of fatigue damage of such elements is the long-term stress cycle distribution at critical locations on the helix '
            'elements caused by long-term environmental loading on the system. The long-term stress cycle distribution will therefore require '
            'global dynamic time domain analysis followed by a detailed cross-section analysis in a large number of irregular sea states.')
